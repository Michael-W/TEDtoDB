This project consists of three files:

TED_PHP.Class.php - This is the TED_PHP class by Garrett Bartley available
    from http://github.com/wgbartley/TED_PHP.  I found and fixed some problems:
      * The 'get_username()' function had '()' after 'this->username'.
      * In function 'init_url() function had a reference to '$ssl'.  This
            should have been '$this->ssl.
      * I activated the commented code in 'init_curl()' after changing
            '$ssl' to '$this->ssl'.
      * I added values to those passed to the class when called.
      * I reformatted the code to make it easier for me to understand
            while finding the problems.

TEDtoDB.php - An application to load a table with kWh and $ data for all
   history intervals.  The kWh and $ values from TED are adjusted so that
   60 minute records will add up to one hour record, and so on.

combined_history.sql - to create the table on MySQL.

To run the program from Windows Scheduler:
    TEDtoDB.php --interval minute --quiet
        (every 10 minutes)
    TEDtoDB.php --interval hour   --quiet
        (every hour at 15 minutes after the hour)
    TEDtoDB.php --interval day    --quiet
        (every day at 01:30:00)
    TEDtoDB.php --interval month  --quiet
        (every 1st day of the month at 01:15:00)

I was running the hour and day jobs at 5 minutes after the event but discovered
that a bogus record was inserted with incorrect values that were updated the
following run.  The run times above work as expected.

I have not yet had the scheduler run a new month job.

I don't collect second data.  The script will if you need it.

To get things started run the job once for each interval after you have
created the table in the database and you will collect everything that TED has.

If you have more than one MTU (I don't) I expect that the script will discover
them.  Post a reply if this does not happen.
